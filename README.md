This site explores the samples given by the following API: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. The dataset is from a study that recoded the microbial species (or OTUs) found in the subject's/sample's belly button. The site displays the demographic information, a horizontal bar graph of the top OTUs of the sample, and a bubble chart of all the OTUs in the sample along with a dropdown menu to select the sample of interest by the sample's id.
